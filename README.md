## Building and packaging

This package uses the default [Maven build lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html), so you can use the standard Maven commands for compiling and packaging. The most common ones are:

To compile:
```bash
$ mvn compile
```

To build a packaged JAR:
```bash
$ mvn package
```
This will create a .jar file in the `target/` directory.

To clean all the artifacts of a previous build:
```bash
$ mvn clean
```
